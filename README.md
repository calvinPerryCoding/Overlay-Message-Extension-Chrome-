## Issues Publishing to Chrome Web Store 
I have had great difficulties publishing this app to the Chrome Web Store, most likely because of the permission required for the app. The app requires to store information in your browser in order to display the overlay message at a set time.

## Notes:
* Time is actually a 24 hour clock, example: if you want the message to occur at 2:30 PM you have to enter 14:30 as the time
* I could not find the envelope image that I used to create the icon
